Disclamer:
This code is used for half-automation (means you will need have preparation, and you can't use the computer at the moment of running)

Before prepartion:
1. Computer ratio should be 1920x1080 (IMPORTANT)
2. Hide the taskbar

Manual instruction:
1. Main menu should be in first tab
2. Open Transfer Note, filter completed and unbilled
3. Filter transfer to (prevent billed same account)
4. Caps Lock off
5. Run python file and press F8

Happy automation!
